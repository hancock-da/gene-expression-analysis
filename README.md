Environmental stressors are often tested individually in laboratory conditions however, organisms 
experience a wide range of environmental stressors simultaneously in nature. Soil dwelling 
organisms will regularly encounter a variety of contaminants at varying concentrations over a 
range of temperatures. It is therefore pertinent and important that interactions between natural 
and chemical stressors are investigated in order to have a more complete understanding of 
ecotoxicological fitness effects in soil dwelling organisms.

This study investigated the effects of cadmium exposure and heat shock on the expression 
of Vitellogenin (Vg), a gene related to reproduction, and Heat Shock Protein 70 (HSP70), 
involved in protection of protein structure in Folsomia candida. These organisms belong to a 
group who play a remarkable role in litter decomposition, collembolans and are used extensively as a model organism in soil biology.

# Hypotheses and Research Questions:
1. Vg expression
> - Does cadmium exposure or heat shock have a significant effect on Vg transcription 
levels?
> - Treatment with cadmium exposure and heat shock will have reduced Vg transcription 
than either stressor individually and the control group.
2. HSP70 expression
> - HSP70 expression will increase in heat shock treatments.
> - Cadmium exposure will have no effect on HSP70 expression in F. candida.
3. Vg and HSP70 correlation
> - Expression of Vg will reduce as HSP70 increases

# Treatment groups:

**Regarding the candida_data.xlsx file:**

**Gene expression levels of Vg and HSP70 are given in an arbitrary unit that is relative to the 
reference gene, YWHAZ which does not change expression level across environments**
